# HackPack Launcher

Welcome to the HackPack Launcher repository. This project is an advanced, automated projectile launching system that integrates machine vision and precise mechanical control. The launcher is capable of detecting and tracking faces, adjusting its orientation, and executing launch commands through a web-based control interface.

## Project Overview

The HackPack Launcher showcases the capabilities of embedded systems in robotics and computer vision, even within the constraints of limited computational resources. It is designed for enthusiasts in robotics and students looking to explore advanced concepts in a practical, hands-on way.

### Key Features

- **Automated Tracking**: Utilizes machine vision to automatically track faces within its field of view.
- **Web Interface**: Controlled entirely through a web interface, allowing for easy and intuitive operation.
- **Customizable**: Open to modifications and enhancements by users looking to expand its capabilities.
